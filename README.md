# VPAID Demo

I am using the example code from 
[IAB Specification](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VPAID_2_0_Final_04-10-2012.pdf).  However, this
document is more of a gist, and not a runnable project.  To better demonstrate the power and flexibility of VPAID, it
would be instructive to use the reference to create:

* A working VPAID ad
* A working VPAID implementation

## Getting Started

Open up index.html in your browser.

### Prerequisites

None


## Contributing

Just Fork and do a PR.  I'll try to review and incorporate in a timely manner!
